Almost all of theese feel like they'd have multiple files per block.
This is how I see it being broken down, ofc, if you have something to change/add/remove, I'm all ears ^^

different input handling
{
	map, multiple maps, standard
}

map validation
{
	seeing if given map follows the rules set by assignment
}

box generator
{
	seeing where and what kind of boxes can we fit
}

box picker
{
	picks a box that fits the criteria of the assignment out of the options given by box generator
}

printer
{
	prints out the outcome on the map that was given via input, like was shown in the example
}

Makefile & related
{
	for making it into a runnable program
}
